## Overview
### Description
With so many books read also comes unused or thrown away bookmarks. Our app BooksManager is an app that will allow for readers to save their space in their books without having so spend so much on tassles or have to produce waste through the use of bookmarks. Also, we plan to also help readers discover new books in an explore section.
