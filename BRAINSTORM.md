1. Github Profile Information
    - Github provides a lot of public information about a user that will be useful to pull.
    - Would need a backend to persist users to save github token
    - Functionality would be to allow user to see information on repositories like contributers
    - Main idea: count the number of characters for each programming language and show a graph showing how much a github user uses a specific language

2. CS Teammate matcher
    - Having an app that can help CS students find teammates for their project for specific class.
    - This will need a back-end database that'll be use to store the user detail and project detail
    - Main function will be matching students with different skillset needed for a project, such as matching a front-end person with a back-end student

3. Books tracking app
    - Keeping track of books read and store in database
    - Display information about current books
    - Marking pages on books
    - Can pull book information from APIs

Choice: Option 3 (Books tracking app)
